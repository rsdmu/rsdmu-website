As cities become increasingly diverse, marginalized communities—including elderly women, LGBTQ+ individuals, people with disabilities, and indigenous populations—experience differential access and utilization of these spaces. This lack of inclusivity can lead to socially fragmented urban environments and reduced social cohesion.</p>\n<h2>Project Objectives</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Assess Inclusivity:</strong> Develop AI models to evaluate the inclusiveness of public spaces in Montreal.</li>\n<li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> Involve diverse citizen groups in the assessment and design process to ensure public spaces meet varied community needs.</li>\n<li><strong>Ethical AI Development:</strong> Implement participatory and intersectoral AI production methods to address potential biases and ethical challenges.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Methodology and Analyses</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Semi-Structured Interviews:</strong><br>\nConducted with representatives of diverse groups in Montreal to gather insights into the utilization of street spaces by marginalized communities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Focus Group Exercises:</strong><br>\nEngaged 20 participants from varied backgrounds to evaluate aspects like safety and accessibility in urban spaces using curated Mapillary images.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Pairwise Image Comparison:</strong><br>\nPairwise comparisons and labeling of 15,000 Mapillary images, guided by criteria developed from interviews and focus groups.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Algorithm Training and Evaluation:</strong><br>\nFine-tuned a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) pretrained on ImageNet to correlate image attributes with inclusivity scores, followed by workshop evaluations with participants.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Results and Impact</h2>\n<p>The heatmap below illustrates the inclusivity of various public spaces in Montreal based on our AI model's analysis.</p>\n<p><strong>Explore the inclusivity heatmap <a href=\"https://mid-spaces.github.io/landing-page/montreal_folium_heatmap_group_inclusivity.html\">here</a>.</strong></p>\n<p>The heatmap generated from the AI model highlights areas in Montreal that are more or less inclusive. Key findings include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Predictive Accuracy:</strong> The AI model achieved approximately 90% accuracy in predicting the inclusivity of public spaces based on spatial elements like sidewalk construction and surrounding buildings.</li>\n<li><strong>Community Insights:</strong> Engagement with diverse community groups provided valuable criteria that enhanced the model’s relevance and effectiveness.</li>\n<li><strong>Urban Planning:</strong> The heatmap serves as a tool for urban planners to identify and address areas needing improvement, fostering more inclusive and cohesive urban environments.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Future Directions</h2>\n<p>-<strong>Platform Development:</strong> Create a user-friendly platform to facilitate public consultations, allowing citizens to visualize and contribute to the design of their neighborhoods.</p>\n<p>-<strong>Data Expansion:</strong> Increase the dataset with more images to improve AI model accuracy and reduce biases.</p>\n<p>-<strong>Partnerships and Funding:</strong> Seek collaborations and funding to pilot the platform and expand the project’s reach.</p>\n<h2>Related Links</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.umontreal.ca/\">University of Montreal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mila.quebec/en\">Mila - Quebec AI Institute</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://unesco-studio.umontreal.ca/\">UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Tags</h2>\n<div class=\"tags\">\n  <span class=\"tag\">Artificial Intelligence</span>\n  <span class=\"tag\">Urban Planning</span>\n  <span class=\"tag\">Inclusivity</span>\n  <span class=\"tag\">Community Engagement</span>\n  <span class=\"tag\">Public Spaces</span>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Co-Producing AI for Evaluating Public Spaces","date":"2024-11-11","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/png;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/405e8fcb6bf91acf57648dda52239623/da7ad/points_60.png","srcSet":"/static/405e8fcb6bf91acf57648dda52239623/64857/points_60.png 332w,\n/static/405e8fcb6bf91acf57648dda52239623/ac967/points_60.png 664w,\n/static/405e8fcb6bf91acf57648dda52239623/da7ad/points_60.png 1328w","sizes":"(min-width: 1328px) 1328px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/405e8fcb6bf91acf57648dda52239623/02a57/points_60.avif 332w,\n/static/405e8fcb6bf91acf57648dda52239623/b3d0d/points_60.avif 664w,\n/static/405e8fcb6bf91acf57648dda52239623/1fde4/points_60.avif 1328w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1328px) 1328px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/405e8fcb6bf91acf57648dda52239623/35309/points_60.webp 332w,\n/static/405e8fcb6bf91acf57648dda52239623/c6ce1/points_60.webp 664w,\n/static/405e8fcb6bf91acf57648dda52239623/d3d28/points_60.webp 1328w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1328px) 1328px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":843.3734939759037}}},"description":"A collaborative project utilizing AI to assess and design inclusive public spaces in Montreal, integrating community input and ethical AI practices.","author":"Rashid Mushkani, University of Montreal, Mila - Quebec AI Institute","path":"co-producing-ai-evaluating-public-spaces"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"co-producing-ai-evaluating-public-spaces"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1719329430","3000541721"],"slicesMap":{}}
