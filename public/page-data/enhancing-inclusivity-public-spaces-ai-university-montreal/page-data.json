There is a need to identify the factors that contribute to the inclusiveness or exclusiveness of these spaces to ensure they accommodate the diverse needs of all citizens.</p>\n<h2>Project Objectives</h2>\n<p>The project aims to develop AI models to assess the inclusiveness of public spaces and utilize generative AI to create conceptual designs tailored to the city's context. It also involves diverse citizen groups in the assessment and design process to ensure that public spaces meet various community needs.</p>\n<h2>Methodology</h2>\n<p>A predictive AI model was developed using approximately 60 data points, achieving around 90% accuracy in predicting inclusivity based on spatial elements. Additionally, a generative AI model was created to produce conceptual designs aligned with Montreal's context, facilitating the visualization of urban environments. Community workshops were conducted with 20 participants from different backgrounds to formulate AI prompts and ensure the models reflect diverse user perspectives.</p>\n<h2>Results and Impact</h2>\n<p>Comming ...!</p>\n<h2>Related Links</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.umontreal.ca/\">University of Montreal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mila.quebec/en\">Mila - Quebec AI Institute</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mila.quebec/en/ai4humanity/applied-projects/artificial-intelligence-alignment-for-inclusion-aiai\">AIAI, Mila - Quebec AI Institute</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://unesco-studio.umontreal.ca/\">UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Tags</h2>\n<div class=\"tags\">\n  <span class=\"tag\">Artificial Intelligence</span>\n  <span class=\"tag\">Urban Planning</span>\n  <span class=\"tag\">Inclusivity</span>\n  <span class=\"tag\">Community Engagement</span>\n  <span class=\"tag\">Public Spaces</span>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Thesis Project: Street Review & Wedesign","date":"2023-05-30","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/b8cc873d680f549bdf0e7f220ca41dd0/dd7f8/thesis_project.jpg","srcSet":"/static/b8cc873d680f549bdf0e7f220ca41dd0/05972/thesis_project.jpg 350w,\n/static/b8cc873d680f549bdf0e7f220ca41dd0/7f0f5/thesis_project.jpg 700w,\n/static/b8cc873d680f549bdf0e7f220ca41dd0/dd7f8/thesis_project.jpg 1400w,\n/static/b8cc873d680f549bdf0e7f220ca41dd0/680ad/thesis_project.jpg 2800w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/b8cc873d680f549bdf0e7f220ca41dd0/9c5ce/thesis_project.avif 350w,\n/static/b8cc873d680f549bdf0e7f220ca41dd0/eb275/thesis_project.avif 700w,\n/static/b8cc873d680f549bdf0e7f220ca41dd0/675cc/thesis_project.avif 1400w,\n/static/b8cc873d680f549bdf0e7f220ca41dd0/57fd0/thesis_project.avif 2800w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/b8cc873d680f549bdf0e7f220ca41dd0/14999/thesis_project.webp 350w,\n/static/b8cc873d680f549bdf0e7f220ca41dd0/f7346/thesis_project.webp 700w,\n/static/b8cc873d680f549bdf0e7f220ca41dd0/233c0/thesis_project.webp 1400w,\n/static/b8cc873d680f549bdf0e7f220ca41dd0/3ae2f/thesis_project.webp 2800w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":807}}},"description":"Utilizing AI models to assess and design inclusive public spaces in Montreal, fostering community engagement and urban improvement.","author":"Rashid Mushkani, University of Montreal, Mila - Quebec AI Institute","path":"enhancing-inclusivity-public-spaces-ai-university-montreal"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"enhancing-inclusivity-public-spaces-ai-university-montreal"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
