Furthermore, we aim to finetune these visualization tools using images that align with localized notions of equitable, diverse and inclusive public space. To achieve this, we built the MID-Space dataset. It contains preferences for urban public spaces based on criteria such as inclusivity, diversity and comfort.

For the moment, only classical ethnographic approaches are capable of doing this. Subjecting the quality of public space to the prism of artificial intelligence is therefore an approach that needs to be explored and developed. The project that we have developed draws on these issues. An AI was created to assess the quality of public spaces based on a set of images representative of the richness of Montreal's urban landscape. The approach is based on participatory urban planning thinking, while taking advantage of the opportunities offered by AI. This proposal focuses on highlighting the usefulness and relevance of AI approaches to designing the city. Its aim is to provide a concrete response for better qualification and better production of an inclusive urban environment.","pdf":"./documents/hs-web-of-conferences-203-01005.pdf","date":"2024-12-12"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"AI-EDI-SPACE: A Co-designed Dataset for Evaluating the Quality of Public Spaces","path":"ai-edi-space-co-designed-dataset-public-spaces","thumbnail":{"publicURL":"/static/de3c18395119917502a3fa1913ce60c2/ai_edi_space.png"},"author":"Shreeyash Gowaikar, Hugo Berard, Rashid Mushkani, Emmanuel Beaudry Marchand, Toumadher Ammar, Shin Koseki","link":"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2411.00956","abstract":"Advancements in AI heavily rely on large-scale datasets meticulously curated and annotated for training. However, concerns persist regarding the transparency and context of data collection methodologies, especially when sourced through crowdsourcing platforms. Crowdsourcing often employs low-wage workers with poor working conditions and lacks consideration for the representativeness of annotators, leading to algorithms that fail to represent diverse views and perpetuate biases against certain groups. To address these limitations, we propose a methodology involving a co-design model that actively engages stakeholders at key stages, integrating principles of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) to ensure diverse viewpoints. We apply this methodology to develop a dataset and AI model for evaluating public space quality using street view images, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing diverse perspectives and fostering higher-quality data.","pdf":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00956.pdf","date":"2024-12-12"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"From Efficiency to Equity: Measuring Fairness in Preference Learning","path":"from-efficiency-to-equity-measuring-fairness-preference-learning","thumbnail":{"publicURL":"/static/041ac8198f08cad2bda0baf959bef39a/from_efficiency_to_equity.png"},"author":"Shreeyash Gowaikar, Hugo Berard, Rashid Mushkani, Shin Koseki","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18841","abstract":"As AI systems, particularly generative models, increasingly influence decision-making, ensuring that they are able to fairly represent diverse human preferences becomes crucial. This paper introduces a novel framework for evaluating epistemic fairness in preference learning models inspired by economic theories of inequality and Rawlsian justice. We propose metrics adapted from the Gini Coefficient, Atkinson Index, and Kuznets Ratio to quantify fairness in these models. We validate our approach using two datasets: a custom visual preference dataset (AI-EDI-Space) and the Jester Jokes dataset. Our analysis reveals variations in model performance across users, highlighting potential epistemic injustices. We explore pre-processing and in-processing techniques to mitigate these inequalities, demonstrating a complex relationship between model efficiency and fairness. This work contributes to AI ethics by providing a framework for evaluating and improving epistemic fairness in preference learning models, offering insights for developing more inclusive AI systems in contexts where diverse human preferences are crucial.","pdf":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.18841.pdf","date":"2024-12-12"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Urban Planning, Political System, and Public Participation in a Century of Urbanization: Kabul, Afghanistan","path":"urban-planning-political-system-public-participation-kabul","thumbnail":{"publicURL":"/static/39a97345ecd65f02136ac94c30fbb3ed/sherry.svg"},"author":"Rashid Mushkani, Haruka Ono","link":"https://doi.org/10.1080/23311886.2022.2045452","abstract":"This study examined the role of centralized national, decentralized supranational, and multiplied Foucauldian powers in a century of urbanization and urban planning in Afghanistan’s capital city. Centralized domestic and decentralized foreign powers are framed as vertical planning and technical rationality, whereas the multiplied Foucauldian power is framed as participatory planning and discursive rationality. Within this theoretical framework, the available urban planning literature concerning Afghanistan’s urbanization process from 1919 to 2020 is surveyed. The period starting from 1919 to 1921 marks the country’s independence and first major undertaking of urban development, whereas the period of 2018–2020 denotes the urban design framework preparation and tendency of its application for Kabul City. Three distinct paradigms; namely, biopower, complementary, and sporadic urban planning and development can be demonstrated by tracing the role of power and the political system in scope, method, vision, and authorization of urban plans for the country. In complementary and sporadic planning paradigms, the decentralized supranational powers guide urban development and planning, whereas the centralized domestic power guides urban development in the biopower paradigm. Within these paradigms, despite the claims and leaps of democratic political regime exercises, a few traces of participatory planning in upgrading projects of unplanned settlements occurred only recently. However, the urban planning regime has lacked discursive rationality and has not accepted meaningful citizen participation in the planning process.","pdf":"./documents/cogent-social-sciences-urban-planning-kabul.pdf","date":"2024-12-12"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"The Role of Land Use and Vitality in Fostering Gender Equality in Urban Public Parks: The Case of Kabul City, Afghanistan","path":"the-role-of-land-use-and-vitality-gender-equality-kabul","thumbnail":{"publicURL":"/static/f1f859027368b627e00c784388507102/img_40siton.jpg"},"author":"Rashid Mushkani, Haruka Ono","link":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2021.102462","abstract":"This qualitative study employs observation, one-on-one semi-structured interviews, and questionnaire data collection methods to focus on land use and its correlation with vitality and gender equality in the public park domain. The study addresses the human–environment dichotomy and seeks to provide findings that can serve as a basis for city planning and foster gender pervasiveness in our recreational milieu. The study is framed in an expanding city and the Muslim context of Afghanistan, which has been at the intersection of fundamentalism and modernity since the mid-20th century. In the capital city of Kabul, 15 out of 65 active public parks were selected based on the criteria of having essential park amenities and variety in surrounding land uses. Vitality measures such as the presence of people in a park, the diversity of activities and available amenities, and the parks' build quality and management attributes were examined and contextualized according to the various land-use zones: residential, commercial, and mixed use. Parks surrounded by residential zones were found to be more vital, foster a higher female presence compared to parks surrounded by other land-use functions, and benefit from the influence of socio-spatial bonds induced by the neighborhood unit due to the presence of people and the park's perceived safety and security. Finally, a thematic proposal that can contribute to future urban planning is presented.","pdf":"./documents/1-s2.0-S019739752100151X-main.pdf","date":"2024-12-12"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Spatial Equity of Public Parks: A Case Study of Kabul City, Afghanistan","path":"spatial-equity-public-parks-kabul","thumbnail":{"publicURL":"/static/e4959ea6ca463d3088282a3e6a99b005/spatial_equity.png"},"author":"Rashid Mushkani, Haruka Ono","link":"https://doi.org/10.3390/su13031516","abstract":"Accessibility, the size of the land area, the design and build quality, and the number of parks and their correlation with population density are key elements in fostering ecological spatial equity within cities. This study analyzed different spatial equity attributes of existing parks in Kabul City using onsite observations, measurement analyses, and mapping and buffering of satellite imagery using computer-aided design methods. The results revealed that, presently, 309 ha of urban land is covered by parks, which accounts for 0.78% of the total land area of 394.78 km². On average, a quarter of city residents can access a park with basic amenities within 300 to 600 m of their residence, and parks currently provide a land coverage distribution per resident of 0.69 m². However, the majority of parks lack certain amenities like playground and sports facilities desired by different user groups. This article also explored the inequitable distribution of parks at the city scale, underlining the scarcity or concentration of parks in certain areas and stressing the importance of allocating additional land for park provision.","pdf":"./documents/sustainability-13-01516.pdf","date":"2024-12-12"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Public Spaces of Developing Countries Post COVID-19: A Reflection on Current Situation from Planning Perspective in Case of Kabul City, Afghanistan","path":"public-spaces-developing-countries-post-covid19-kabul","thumbnail":{"publicURL":"/static/89612c4147fe866a70b9de66bbbab6e6/kucha_kabul.png"},"author":"Rashid Mushkani, Haruka Ono","link":"https://osf.io/preprints/osf/ey752","abstract":"Social distancing, stay home & stay safe, and avoiding public space usage have been the slogans to battle against the invisible enemy (COVID-19 pandemic). These measures are placed by the government to minimize transmission of the disease among urban residents. In pace with developed countries, many developing countries across the world have simulated the same measures to reduce transmission and contain the disease. Although it is believed that the outcomes would differ (WHO, 2020), most residents are complying with public health officials' recommendations. Empty streets, minimal public spaces, and reduced usage of parks and plazas are evidence of this scenario. The aim of this paper is to examine the impacts of the current situation, i.e., COVID-19 pandemic countermeasures, on public spaces. It proposes tentative planning and design incentives for developing countries and encourages research on how the planning and design of our cities can evolve to be more resilient for similar future challenges.","pdf":"./documents/post-covid19-kabul.pdf","date":"2024-12-12"}}}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["1719329430","2402622801","3000541721"],"slicesMap":{}}
