## The Big Idea

**Street Review** is a people-powered audit that asks:  
> Who actually feels welcome here—and who doesn’t?

We blend interviews, focus groups, and structured ratings to see how different communities experience city streets. In Montréal, something striking emerged: not a single street satisfied all intersectional user needs. Yet when groups sat down to talk, they began negotiating—sometimes fiercely—what “inclusive” really means.

## Why This Matters

Inclusive streets aren’t just ramps and benches; they must signal belonging across cultures, ages, and mobilities. Conversations can shift how people perceive *accessibility*, but *inclusivity* is harder to resolve. Comparing pre- and post-visit ratings shows how familiarity reshapes judgment, pointing to context-specific, diversity-sensitive design over one-size-fits-all fixes.

## How We Did It

**Participants:** 28 in interviews/focus groups, with 12 providing structured ratings. **Sampling:** 20 streets × 3 vantage points × 2 images—60 locations and 120 images chosen for diversity in land use, history, density, greenery, and amenities. **Data:** 600+ descriptors distilled into four core dimensions—Inclusivity, Accessibility, Aesthetics, Practicality. **Analysis:** Thematic coding, LDA topic modeling, and correlation checks across intersectional groups.

## What We Found

Most streets performed *adequately* but rarely excelled across all dimensions. Accessibility and Practicality tended to move together; Aesthetics was a wildcard. Barriers varied by identity—LGBTQIA2+ folks, mobility-impaired users, elders, and newcomers flagged different frictions. Group dialogue boosted awareness of accessibility gaps, even as debates over inclusivity stayed lively.

## Where This Can Be Used

**Urban planning** can combine solo and group feedback to shape street design; **policy** can deploy multilingual signs and cultural cues that say “you belong here”; **research** can adapt Street Review across cities and contexts.
