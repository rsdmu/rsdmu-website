## Problem

Cities often rely on standardized audits to judge street quality, but lived experiences vary widely across gender, age, mobility, culture, and income. This gap makes it hard for planners to understand where people *agree* (e.g., aesthetics) and where they *disagree* (e.g., inclusivity, practicality)—and to manage streets accordingly.

## Project Objectives

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">

- **Map Perceptions:** Capture how Montréal residents assess streets across criteria like accessibility, inclusivity, aesthetics, and practicality.  
- **Compare Individual vs. Group Judgments:** See where opinions converge or diverge when people evaluate alone vs. in discussion.  
- **Inform Management:** Translate agreement/disagreement patterns into actionable guidance for inclusive street design and upkeep.

## Methodology and Analyses

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">

1. **Interviews (n=28):**  
   Semi-structured interviews via community-organization partners surfaced 12 criteria residents use to describe street quality: accessibility, inviting, comfortable, regenerative, beautiful, practical, maintained, inclusive, dynamic, representative, oppressive, and secure.

2. **Focus Groups + Rating (n=12):**  
   Three mixed-background groups rated 20 curated Montréal street-view images on **accessibility, inclusivity, aesthetics, practicality**—first individually, then collectively after moderated discussion.

3. **Ranking (n=17):**  
   On a separate day, participants **ranked** 7 images against all 12 criteria to reveal where consensus is strongest/weakest.

4. **Reliability + Agreement:**  
   We analyzed results using **Pearson correlation**, **Kendall’s Tau**, and **Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC)** to measure convergence/divergence and the effect of group deliberation.

## Results and Impact

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">

- **Where people converge:** Stronger agreement on **aesthetics** and **regenerative** qualities—features like greenery, coherent design, and places that feel restorative.  
- **Where people diverge:** **Inclusivity**, **practicality**, and sometimes **maintenance** showed low or mixed agreement, reflecting context, identity, and lived experience.  
- **Why groups help:** Small-group discussion **reduced disagreement**—especially for **accessibility** and **inclusivity**—suggesting that structured dialogue can clarify contested ideas and produce more stable guidance for managers.  
- **Managerial takeaway:** Use clear benchmarks for physical features (e.g., curb ramps, seating, lighting), but pair them with **repeated, small-group consultations** to negotiate local meanings of inclusivity and practicality.

## Future Directions

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">

- **Scaled Engagement:** Embed recurring, small-group dialogues into municipal consultation cycles to surface and reconcile contested criteria.  
- **Richer Media:** Complement still images with short videos/360° views to capture flow, noise, and time-of-day changes.  
- **Broader Cohorts:** Expand to additional communities (e.g., teens, Indigenous groups) and neighborhoods to test generalizability.
