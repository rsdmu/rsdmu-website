## Overview

Cities often judge street quality with standardized audits, yet lived experiences vary across gender, age, mobility, culture, and income. This study asks where Montréal residents tend to **agree** (for instance, on aesthetics) and where they **diverge** (often on inclusivity and practicality), and how small-group discussion can turn contested ideas into clearer guidance for managers.

## What we set out to learn

We explored how people describe and evaluate streets, alone and together. The goal was to map the criteria residents actually use, measure where judgments converge or split, and translate those patterns into decisions about design, maintenance, and programming.

## How we did it

We conducted 28 semi-structured interviews with community-organization partners to surface twelve recurring criteria people use to talk about streets: accessibility, inviting, comfortable, regenerative, beautiful, practical, maintained, inclusive, dynamic, representative, oppressive, and secure.

Building on that, three mixed-background focus groups (12 participants total) rated 20 curated Montréal street-view images on **accessibility**, **inclusivity**, **aesthetics**, and **practicality**—first independently, then again after moderated discussion. A separate ranking exercise with 17 participants ordered seven images against all twelve criteria. We assessed convergence and reliability using Pearson correlation, Kendall’s Tau, and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC).

## What we found

Agreement was **strongest** for qualities tied to visible, shared cues—particularly **aesthetics** and **regenerative** features like greenery, coherence, and places that feel restorative. It was **weakest or mixed** for **inclusivity**, **practicality**, and at times **maintenance**—domains shaped by identity, context, and prior experience.

Crucially, small-group dialogue **tightened agreement**, especially for **accessibility** and **inclusivity**. Discussion helped participants articulate what they meant by “for whom” and “in what situations,” producing more stable judgments than individual ratings alone.

## Why it matters for management

Audits work well for physical benchmarks—curb ramps, seating, lighting, shade—where agreement is naturally higher. But for dimensions where experiences diverge, technical checklists aren’t enough. Embedding **recurring, small-group consultations** into routine management cycles can surface contested meanings early, reduce noise in evaluations, and guide more inclusive choices about design trade-offs, operations, and programming.

## Looking ahead

We plan to scale the process across more neighborhoods, invite under-represented cohorts (e.g., teens and Indigenous communities), and test richer media—short videos and 360° views—to better capture flow, noise, and time-of-day change.
