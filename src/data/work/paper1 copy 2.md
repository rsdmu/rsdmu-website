# Abstract

This qualitative study employs observation, one-on-one semi-structured interviews, and questionnaire data collection methods to examine land use and its correlation with vitality and gender equality in public parks. The study addresses the human–environment dichotomy and aims to provide findings that can inform city planning and foster gender inclusivity in recreational spaces. Framed in the expanding city and Muslim context of Afghanistan—particularly Kabul, which has been at the intersection of fundamentalism and modernity since the mid-20th century—this study selected 15 of 65 active public parks based on essential amenities and varied surrounding land uses.

Vitality measures such as the presence of people, diversity of activities, available amenities, and quality and management attributes of parks were examined in residential, commercial, and mixed-use zones. Parks surrounded by residential areas were found to be more vital, attracted higher female presence, and benefited from neighborhood-induced socio-spatial bonds due to perceived safety and security. A thematic proposal for future urban planning is presented based on these findings.
