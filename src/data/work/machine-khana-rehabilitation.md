**Project team:** Led by the AKCS-A team. I had the pleasure of working with the design team on this project for a year at the beginning before moving to Japan mid-2019.

## Project Overview

The **Kabul Riverfront Transformation** project, initiated by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture, aimed to develop a Heritage Zone along the Kabul River in the Old City. This involved restoring the 19th-century Machine Khana industrial complex by converting historic warehouses and administrative buildings into commercial and public spaces. The architecture balanced preserving original structures with adding modern facilities, including new utilities and extensive landscaping. Public amenities such as libraries and exhibition halls were created to support community engagement and economic growth. Led by the AKCS-A team and completed at the end of 2023, the project improved living and working conditions, stimulated the local economy, and maintained Kabulâ€™s architectural heritage.
