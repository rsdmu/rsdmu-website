## Problem

Canadian public spaces exhibit varying levels of inclusivity, impacting how different community groups utilize and interact within these environments. There is a need to identify the factors that contribute to the inclusiveness or exclusiveness of these spaces to ensure they accommodate the diverse needs of all citizens.

## Project Objectives

The project aims to develop AI models to assess the inclusiveness of public spaces and utilize generative AI to create conceptual designs tailored to the city's context. It also involves diverse citizen groups in the assessment and design process to ensure that public spaces meet various community needs.

## Methodology

A predictive AI model was developed using approximately 60 data points, achieving around 90% accuracy in predicting inclusivity based on spatial elements. Additionally, a generative AI model was created to produce conceptual designs aligned with Montreal's context, facilitating the visualization of urban environments. Community workshops were conducted with 20 participants from different backgrounds to formulate AI prompts and ensure the models reflect diverse user perspectives.
