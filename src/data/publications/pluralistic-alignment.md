abstract: "LIVS (Local Intersectional Visual Spaces) is a participatory dataset for pluralistic alignment of text-to-image models in the context of inclusive public-space design. Co-developed with 30 community organizations, LIVS encodes 37,710 pairwise comparisons across 13,462 images along six community-defined criteria—Accessibility, Safety, Comfort, Invitingness, Inclusivity, and Diversity—derived from 634 concepts. Using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to fine-tune Stable Diffusion XL, the authors report improved alignment where annotation volume is high; systematic preference differences across participant identities; more decisive annotations from human-authored prompts than LLM-generated ones; and distinct rating patterns for intersectional groups across criteria. The prevalence of neutral ratings underscores heterogeneous, often ambiguous community values and the limits of single-objective alignment. LIVS offers a benchmark and methodology for local, stakeholder-driven, multi-criteria alignment in spatial design."
