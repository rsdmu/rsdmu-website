abstract: "Urban demographic shifts and multicultural dynamics challenge streets to serve heterogeneous users. This paper presents Street Review, a participatory methodology combining interviews, focus groups, and structured image-based ratings to evaluate 20 Montr√©al streets (60 vantage points) across inclusivity, accessibility, aesthetics, and practicality. By contrasting pre-occupancy (newcomers/visitors) with post-occupancy (long-term residents) perspectives, the study shows that most streets perform moderately and that no single street satisfies all intersectional needs. Group deliberation helps calibrate evaluations and surface conflicts rooted in identity, memory, and everyday mobility. Findings translate into guidance for planners seeking equitable, context-sensitive street design in tourism- and migration-affected cities."
