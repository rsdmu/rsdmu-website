abstract: "This position paper proposes a Right to AI—the capacity and entitlement of individuals and communities to meaningfully shape, critique, and govern the AI infrastructures that affect their lives. Drawing inspiration from Lefebvre’s Right to the City and Arnstein’s Ladder of Citizen Participation, the paper reconceptualizes AI as societal infrastructure and contends that data is socially produced and should be collectively managed. Through analysis of nine case studies and a four-tier model of engagement—from consumer-based to citizen-controlled—it outlines pathways for inclusive data ownership, transparent design processes, local councils and data trusts, participatory audits, and conflict-resolution mechanisms. The authors contrast participatory approaches with market-led and state-centric models, arguing that grassroots, stakeholder-driven governance better balances technical efficiency with democratic legitimacy."
