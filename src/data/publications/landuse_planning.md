abstract: "This qualitative study employs observation, one-on-one semi-structured interviews, and questionnaire data collection methods to focus on land use and its correlation with vitality and gender equality in the public park domain. The study addresses the humanâ€“environment dichotomy and seeks to provide findings that can serve as a basis for city planning and foster gender pervasiveness in our recreational milieu. The study is framed in an expanding city and the Muslim context of Afghanistan, which has been at the intersection of fundamentalism and modernity since the mid-20th century. In the capital city of Kabul, 15 out of 65 active public parks were selected based on the criteria of having essential park amenities and variety in surrounding land uses. Vitality measures such as the presence of people in a park, the diversity of activities and available amenities, and the parks' build quality and management attributes were examined and contextualized according to the various land-use zones: residential, commercial, and mixed use. Parks surrounded by residential zones were found to be more vital, foster a higher female presence compared to parks surrounded by other land-use functions, and benefit from the influence of socio-spatial bonds induced by the neighborhood unit due to the presence of people and the park's perceived safety and security. Finally, a thematic proposal that can contribute to future urban planning is presented."
