abstract: "How residents perceive street quality is central to inclusive planning but varies across social identities and contexts. This study with Montréal participants evaluates streetscapes via individual ratings, individual rankings, and moderated group discussions across criteria such as accessibility, inclusivity, practicality, and aesthetics. Individual assessments showed notable discrepancies—especially for inclusivity—while small-group deliberations produced more convergent judgments. The paper proposes a framework that integrates individual and collective evaluations, emphasizing localized, context-sensitive insights for municipal planners. Findings argue for responsive public space management grounded in iterative, small-group engagement to reconcile contested criteria and support a dynamic sense of publicness."
