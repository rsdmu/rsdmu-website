abstract: "Despite growing efforts to address the risks and biases of AI, current approaches often fail to meaningfully include culturally marginalized communities. Drawing on design justice, expansive learning theory, and participatory AI research, this paper proposes an augmented AI lifecycle with five interconnected phases—co-framing, co-design, co-implementation, co-deployment, and co-maintenance—that embed citizens, domain experts, and technologists as co-producers. The lifecycle is informed by four multidisciplinary workshops and aligns with leading ethical frameworks, emphasizing distributed authority, iterative knowledge exchange, and culturally sensitive privacy practices."
