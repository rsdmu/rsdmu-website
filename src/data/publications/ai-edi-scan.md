abstract: "Artificial intelligence (AI) offers many possibilities for an analysis of urban landscapes, but it cannot capture the diversity of viewpoints and differentiated, situated assessments of the quality of public space. For the moment, only classical ethnographic approaches are capable of doing this. Subjecting the quality of public space to the prism of artificial intelligence is therefore an approach that needs to be explored and developed. The project that we have developed draws on these issues. An AI was created to assess the quality of public spaces based on a set of images representative of the richness of Montreal's urban landscape. The approach is based on participatory urban planning thinking, while taking advantage of the opportunities offered by AI. This proposal focuses on highlighting the usefulness and relevance of AI approaches to designing the city. Its aim is to provide a concrete response for better qualification and better production of an inclusive urban environment."
