abstract: "Social distancing, stay home & stay safe, and avoiding public space usage have been the slogans to battle against the invisible enemy (COVID-19 pandemic). These measures are placed by the government to minimize transmission of the disease among urban residents. In pace with developed countries, many developing countries across the world have simulated the same measures to reduce transmission and contain the disease. Although it is believed that the outcomes would differ (WHO, 2020), most residents are complying with public health officials' recommendations. Empty streets, minimal public spaces, and reduced usage of parks and plazas are evidence of this scenario. The aim of this paper is to examine the impacts of the current situation, i.e., COVID-19 pandemic countermeasures, on public spaces. It proposes tentative planning and design incentives for developing countries and encourages research on how the planning and design of our cities can evolve to be more resilient for similar future challenges."
